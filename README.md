# Solved Problems for UVa (University of Valladolid, Spain) online judge
The problems are grouped in the following top-level directories

## solved
These problems have been solved successfully. 
For each problem, the code and test cases for are grouped together in a
directory named **UVa_problem-code_** where _problem-code_ is the the
corresponding UVa problem code.

## todo
These are problems which have been tried but haven't been solved yet.
They do not present much of a challenge, yet due to a slight gloss-over, 
I haven't got AC yet.

## hard
These are also problems that I've tried but haven't got AC on, but
these problems are also conceptually non-obvious unlike the todo problems.
